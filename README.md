# Typescript

## Description
Typescript is an open source programming langauge developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of Javascript (like C++ to C) which means it has all of the features that Javascript has plus some. It brings static typing to Javascript and enhances Javascript's innate dynamic language.
