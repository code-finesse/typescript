<details open>
  <summary>Terms and Explanations</summary>
  
  ## Typescript has 12 basic types
  https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html
<ol>

 1. **boolean** -> true or false
 2. **number** -> just a number
 3. **string** -> just a string
 4. **array** -> [1, 2, 3]
 5. **object** -> non-primitive types
 6. **undefined** -> unassigned value
 7. **null** -> something doesn't exist
 8. **any** -> dynamic type like (like normal js)
 9. **void** -> a function that doesn't return
 10. **never** function that never returns
 11. **tuple** -> [string, number, number] (multiple types inside an array)
 12. **enum** -> outcome {win, lose, draw} (0, 1, 2)
